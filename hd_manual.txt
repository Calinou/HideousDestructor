	   I. INTRODUCTION

The Hideous Destructor weapons and monsters mod is a speculative re-imagining of Doom's gameplay: what if Doom, with its demons and zombies and 80s-metal horrors and ridiculous firepower, didn't hold anything back for the benefit of the player? What if a lone zombie coming at you with an assault rifle became a cause of concern *now*, rather than ten minutes later when your health suddenly dips to single digits because your teammate ran in front of your rocket? What if your guns actually had some serious range and stopping power - as did the enemy's, creating opportunities and risks that would have been much harder to model before? What if, on Phobos, you had to face a force that was much more plausibly capable of wiping out an entire platoon of space marines?

To accomplish this design objective, HD makes four main changes:

- Slowing the player to relatively plausible human speeds subject to fatigue and (some) injury, while providing more options to go faster or slower with appropriate tradeoffs.
- Exaggerating both the strengths and their (relative) weaknesses of all weapons and monsters, turning into key gameplay elements implications hinted at by lore and artwork that are glossed over in canon.
- Creating more incentives for the player not to get hit, while making it much harder to avoid damage without some coherent attack plan and proper use of cover.
- Adding an inventory system to give the player more control over what they collect and use and when.

The result is a more intense, frustrating and brutal experience where everyone is fighting at a much more equal level than before and nothing can be taken for granted. Have fun.


	Using Hideous Destructor with other wads

Hideous Destructor is designed to be run on any map that does not define its own weapons and monsters. Running with other weapon or monster mods is generally not supported.


	  II. GETTING STARTED

To play Hideous Destructor, save the GitHub download into a folder and load that folder as you would any normal GZDoom mod file.

If GZDoom aborts with an error message saying that something has already been defined, then there is a conflict between HD and some other mod you are loading. In that case, unless you know how to go into the mods themselves and mess around with them you'll only be able to run one of those mods at a time. Please e-mail me or post on the ZDoom forums to let me know about the problem so I can rename the actor in future revisions.

The first thing you should do after starting is to check your key bindings. Make sure your run/walk key is set to something you can hold down comfortably while moving, and Reload, Zoom, Drop Weapon and the additional buttons Alternate Reload, Fire Mode and Unload (user buttons 1, 2 and 4 respectively), somewhere easily accessible without being too easy to hit by accident. More about these controls can be found in Part III of this text.

With that done, you're ready to begin.

If you want to try out some of the weapons, load the firing range and try shooting a few things.


	The bleeding system

When you get hit in HD, you not only lose health right away, you also add to a hidden counter that determines how quickly your injuries worsen. This is an abstract system meant to cover everything from body envelope violations to toxicity and radiation poisoning to magical corruption and smoke inhalation, but for convenience I'll refer to this as the bleeding system.

Look down every so often to see if you are leaving a blood trail, or check what message comes up when you use weapon slot 9. Bleeding means you are losing health and will eventually die if it is not stopped. You might randomly recover from bleeding injuries, but for most things you'll likely bleed out before you heal.

Armour not only blocks damage but also reduces the bleeding rate of any injury it blocks.

Supernatural healing bonuses rapidly seal up wounds as needed, buying you time to escape and naturally recuperate. If after you manage to stop bleeding you're still charged up with supernatural healing, it will be used to replenish your health at a much faster than normal rate.

Of the mundane tech items, only medikits can help stop bleeding permanently, though stimpacks and berserk packs might buy you some time.

Absent a proper medikit, you can try to bandage yourself using improvised objects. This is abstracted into weapon #9: just stand still and hold the fire button until the help text tells you you're done. You may take some minor damage and no attempt is guaranteed to work. Your armour is designed to apply pressure and aid you in this so do NOT take it off the way you must to prepare for a medikit. You can do this to someone else, which has a much lower change of causing damage and is much more reliable.

Side note about being on fire: As you cannot truly "stop, drop and roll" in the Doom engine, there is an option of spinning around or turning left and right very quickly to try to put out a fire earlier. Doing so* in liquids**, sand or gooey snake floors while crouched greatly increase your chances of putting out the flames in time.

*or any rapid movement
**other than nukage or lava


	The damage system 

In addition to regular damage, Hideous Destructor tracks burn damage and "aggravated" damage, as well as non-bleeding but still existent wounds. All accumulate to the detriment of your maximum HP.

You slowly heal from all but aggravated damage over time.

Aggravated damage represents long-term damage that cannot be readily healed due to fundamental interference with your body's metaphysical pattern. It can only be healed by supernatural means, but may be inflicted by both supernatural and technological means (most notably balefire and the berserk pack's aftereffects).

Soul sphere and blue potion magic will remove lethal and aggravated damage at the same rate as it helps you recover health.


	The aiming system 

For the most part Hideous Destructor functions like Doom: point the middle of your screen at the monster, hit the fire button, and insha Allah the monster will die.

There is no auto-aim anywhere in HD. In fact, if you move or turn too quickly it can throw off your aim a bit.

Hold Use or Zoom to lower your mouse sensitivity, subject to the hd_aimsensitivity setting. Setting hd_usefocus to false will restrict this behaviour to Zoom. Zoom will also bring up your scope view if your weapon has one and it is not up already.

Typically, if a weapon has a magnified view, hitting both Zoom (NOT Use) and Firemode will let you do things with it. For the rocket launcher (in rocket mode) and Brontornis, this toggles the magnified view.

For the rifles, if you hold both buttons you can move your mouse up and down to adjust the zoom, or tap fire or altfire for more fine-tuned adjustments. If a rifle lets you adjust compensation for bullet drop, you can do the same but with Use instead of Firemode.


	Difficulty levels

Homely: You take 30% damage and you don't bleed from injuries, nor suffer from aggravated or lethal damage, but monsters spawn at Ultra-Violence rates.

Ugly: You take 100% damage and spawn at ITYTD/HNTR rates.
Grotesque: You take 100% damage and spawn at Hurt Me Plenty rates. (Default)
Hideous: You take 100% damage and spawn at Ultra-Violence rates.
Nightmare!: As Hideous, but with fast respawning monsters. Shortcut key N.

Grimdark: You take 120% damage and monsters move fast and spawn at Ultra-Violence rates. Megaspheres are replaced with major armour pickups, stimpacks are replaced with medikits, and health bonuses are replaced with armour bonuses. There is some monster respawn but much slower than nightmare (5 minutes versus 30 seconds). Monsters shoot on sight. Encumbrance is mandatory. Shortcut key G.

Spooky: Same as Grimdark but monsters spawn at ITYTD/HNTR rates.


	Player classes

When you start a new game, you will be asked to select a player class. The classes all have the same inherent properties and differ only in starting equipment.

You can also choose "Custom" to use a custom loadout instead of one of these presets. The customization options can be found in the player menu. You will start holding the first weapon you provide on the list. Amount must be explicitly set (so you can quickly disable and re-enable an item by reducing it to zero instead of scrolling all the way back to "Nothing").

The standard soldier kit includes green armour, a pistol, 3 frags, a DERP and one ladder.

	 III. CONTROLS

Hideous Destructor adds a few non-standard functions. Please read carefully as you will spend most of your gameplay hours unarmed and dead if you do not learn how these things work.


	Reloading

Console commands: +reload, +hd_altreload (or +user1)
Default keys: r, j

Description: Hit the reload key to refill your weapon with your spare ammo. The reload key also serves a few secondary weapon functions (e.g., aborting a hand grenade toss and starting an alternate fist attack) - see those weapon descriptions for details.

When you reload a fixed-magazine weapon like a shotgun or grenade launcher, you load one unit at a time. You will automatically load as many units as you can until you are out of spare units, the gun is full, or you have interrupted the process because you needed to shoot right then (i.e., hold the attack button until you stop reloading).

When you reload a detachable-magazine weapon like a pistol, you will load one full mag, and the old mag is either dropped or (by holding the reload key until you hear yourself going through your pockets) placed back into your inventory with the amount it had at the time of removal. The next time you will reload you will either take one full mag if available, or if there is none, the oldest mag in your stack. These mags will be automatically consolidated between levels; to do this manually, use the mag manager described below.

The alternate reload key lets you:
- with a grenade rifle, reload the underslung grenade;
- with either of the shotguns, load shells from your pockets without touching the ones in the side saddles;
- with the Vulcanette, load a cell;
- with the rocket launcher, load a HEAT rocket; and
- with the plasma rifle and BFG, unload one cell.


	Fire Mode

Console command: +hd_firemode (or +user2)
Default key: h

Description: A couple weapons have alternate fire modes in addition to their primary and secondary attacks.

The assault rifle and SMG have semi, burst and full auto modes. When in burst or full auto, you will see a small yellow bullet icon above the mag counter. Same goes for the battle rifle but without the burst.

The Vulcanette has 2 rates of fire, 2100 and 700 RPM. Setting 2100 RPM will show the same yellow "bullet spam" indicator as other guns' full-auto mode.

All grenade and rocket launchers (for the rifles you must switch to grenade mode first) use fire mode to control airburst, in the same manner as zoom.


	Unload

Console command: +hd_unload (or +user4)
Default key: l

Description: Strips some ammo off the weapon you are carrying. For the shotguns you take the side saddles first; for the vulcanette you take the mags first before the cell.

With both reload and unload, if you hold down the key you will pocket whatever it is you are extracting. However, holding down (or interrupting a sequence by tapping) the reload or unload key in a multi-sequence unload (Vulcanette, rocket launcher, shotgun) will abort the sequence, meaning that with the non-shotguns you can either spill everything everywhere in your haste, or pocket one mag or rocket at a time. (The shotguns will be pocketed whenever possible since you have to pull them out and they'll be in hand anyway.)


	Manage mags (and clips)

Console command: +user3 or "use MagManager"
Default key: none

Description: For weapons that are loaded with magazines or other containers from which you can freely move individual rounds, you can open the magazine manager to fill up some mags/clips for future use - or cannibalize some from one type of mag/clip for the other.

To access the mag manager, type "use MagManager" in the console, or similarly use the specific GZDoom actor name for that mag type, or hit the User3 key for a weapon that uses that ammo type.

As with the backpack, fire and altfire switch from one item to the next, reload puts things into the container and unload takes them out. Hold fire mode and fire/altfire will switch between ammo types, and reload/unload will take mags in and out of your backpack if you have one.


	Rangefinder

Console command: hd_findrange
Default key: none

Description: Logs the distance of the object or map geometry you're pointing at.


	Taunt

Console command: hd_taunt
Default key: b

Description: Yells at the monsters, waking them and causing them to attack you. Sound, depending on player's gender, is either Kuni from the movie UHF (Wheel of Fish scene), Jay's mom from Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back (opening), or a chainsaw.


	Sprinting

Console command: +speed
Default key: Whatever you have set it to

Description: Your unburdened, ininjured movement speed, with "always run" off, is a walk of about 5 km/h. To make a quick dash at full speed (comparable to Usain Bolt), hold on to the +speed key while moving. You will put away your weapon as you sprint (except in the case of your fist and hand grenades).

If you have "always run" on, your normal speed increases to about 18 km/h, but you cannot recover from fatigue while moving at that speed.

Holding sprint and crouch at the same time has you scrambling along the ground, unable to shoot but achieving something close to your normal, unencumbered moving speed.

Your fatigue only increases while you are moving; merely holding the sprint key will not drain your energy.

You can sprint forward continuously for about 100m before tiring out. If at any time you stop sprinting, you must substantially recover from your fatigue before you can start again.

Protip: Holding a lighter weapon lets you start sprinting sooner. If you know you'll have to make a break for it very soon, don't bring out that BFG! (But if you're stuck with it anyway and you absolutely must begin sprinting immediately, dropping the weapon can give you a split second of time.)


	Jumping

Console command: +jump
Default key: Whatever you have set it to

Description: If you walk right up to a ledge between waist and shoulder height, you can press and hold the jump key for about half a second to hoist yourself onto that ledge. You will briefly be unable to fire while doing this. This action cannot be done while crouching.

If you jump while moving forward and the way ahead of you is clear, you will leap forward. Good for crossing gaps and closing in for a beatdown.

If you hit the jump key in any other situation, you will make a normal vertical leap.


	Using

Console command: +use
Default key: Whatever you have set it to

Description: You can open doors with it, as usual. But you also get two other functions:

Pickups: For most things, you must "use" an item to pick it up. If you cannot carry the item, you will put it back on the floor in front of you. For smaller items like loose ammo, you must hold the use key while moving over it to pick it up.

Kicking: pressing use in front of an enemy lets you kick them. (There is no animation for this; this mod is called hideous for a reason.) You can also kick away corpses and hand grenades if they're in the way.

HUD: HD typically hides your complete inventory display. Pressing and holding use brings this up. It will also show how many arbitrary "blocks'" worth of equipment you are carrying.


	Aiming and Turning

If you are standing still, press and hold Use or Zoom to reduce your mouse sensitivity (and enable the scope if hd_noscope is set to true).

If you have some map geometry right underneath where your weapon is pointing (including the floor when you are crouching), or your barrel is touching a vertical wall, this will also brace your gun against it for additional support and precision.

If you must make a very wide turn, you will automatically step to the side as you adjust your body. Turning while already moving ignores this function.

Your turning speed is capped and, depending on your weapon, subject to a bit of inertia. In addition, your turn may be stopped by the muzzle of your weapon colliding with a wall; hold the sprint key or switch to fist or pistol to avoid this.

Lunge/Slide: If you are standing while moving forward or sideways, hit the Crouch button to drop and lunge in the direction you are moving. Your turning will also be affected when you do this. Set hd_noslide to true to limit this behaviour to while sprinting.



	  IV. COMMANDS AND CVARS

	Commands

hd_strip: You do not automatically "overwrite" your currently worn armour by picking up and using new armour. Use the hd_strip command to take off what you're wearing first. If you are not wearing any armour, this command will put on any spare armour you happen to be carrying.
Hitting Reload while you have a medikit in hand, or double-tapping the use item key with another armour selected, will also strip your armour.

hd_dropone: This will drop one unit of each type of ammo that applies to your current weapon. If you have both full mags and loose ammo, you drop all your loose ammo first; otherwise, if you specify a number after this command, you will drop that number instead. (For shotgun shells 4 shells equals one default unit, but if you specify a number you will drop exactly that many shells if you have enough.)

hd_purge: This will drop all ammunition for which you do not have an appropriate weapon, along with empty cells (in the absence of a BFG) and broken robots.

hd_slideon, hd_slideoff: Like hd_zoomon and hd_zoomoff but for the hd_noslide cvar.

hd_clearcvs: Resets all archived CVars (other than loadout cvars) to their defaults.

hd_resetloadout: Resets the custom loadout to default.

hd_resetbackpack. Resets the backpack for the custom loadout to empty.

ab: Type "ab <number>" in the console to set the airburst counter whenever you have an automatic rifle, blooper or rocket launcher out and ready to fire a grenade.

ied: Type "ied <mode> <tag>" in the console to command your deployed IEDs. Mode 2 sets them to passive; 1 sets them to active; 999 detonates all of them at once.
detonate, iedpassive, iedactive: shortcuts for "ied 999", "ied 2" and "ied 1" respectively. Can also take tags.

iedtag: If you feel weird about negative numbers, use this command to set your IED tag instead.

herp: Type "herp <mode> <tag> <direction>" in the console to command your deployed HERPs, in a similar fashion to IEDs. Modes 1-2 are active and inactive respectively; mode 3 lets you change their base angle using the direction parameter (in degrees going counterclockwise).

herptag: as iedtag.

herpdir: Type "herp <direction> <tag>" as a shortcut alternative to "herp 3 <tag> <direction>". Useful if you only have one HERP and don't want to bother typing that extra zero.

teamspawn: In team deathmatch, any member of a team can type "teamspawn 666" in the console to set their own current position as the team spawnpoint. Similarly, any member of a team can type "teamspawn -1" or "teamspawn 999" to clear the team spawnpoint and resume respawning in random places. This is intended to allow your team to establish a well-fortified camping ground to cause as much grief to the opposing team as possible. THIS CAN CAUSE A TELEFRAG IF YOU FAIL TO COORDINATE.

hd_doomguy (cheat): This command, available anytime and not considered a cheat, will set you back to the good old naked marine with a pistol and 50 bullets.



	CVars (host only)

hd_forcepistolstart: This has the same effect as if everyone voluntarily picked the Doomed Guy class, with more griping.

hd_onemanarmy: An important concession HD makes by default for regular Doom gameplay. Every item you carry starts to slow you down a bit. When this server cvar is set to 1, the encumbrance calculation conveniently ignores every weapon except the one you have out in front of you, and every piece of ammo that that weapon cannot use (your second pistol counting as ammo for your first, and reloading supplies like brass and spare ZM66 powder is not counted for the Liberator). If this cvar is set to 2, then *only* your weapon and backpack count towards encumbrance. If this cvar is zero, or you are playing deathmatch or Grimdark/Spooky difficulty, all weapons and ammo count toward your encumbrance. This cvar has no effect on usable items, armour and backpacks, and having an *ERP or lite-amp on you means supplies used by those items will also be counted (since you can deploy them without switching weapons). Default 1.

hd_nobots: This causes bots to be replaced with riflemen. Can be used for coop and deathmatch. Generally far more competent, but cannot use customized loadouts and can sometimes appear in odd places.

hd_lowdamage: Reduces all incoming damage to 30% as though on the lowest skill difficulty. Does not stack with said lowest skill difficulty but does offset Grimdark/Spooky and Nightmare damage increases.

hd_nobleed: Eliminates all bleeding.

hd_killerbarrels: Sets the percentage chance that any barrel (nukage or flaming) will be a killer barrel. Default 5.

hd_nodoorbuster: Some weapons such as the H.E.A.T. rocket and the Brontornis can destroy small pieces of map geometry, letting you bypass tedious or impossible-to-reach areas. This can result in unpredictable or unwanted behaviour, so enabling this option will prevent such weapons from being able to affect map geometry this way. Enabling this midgame will not reverse any damage already done. Default false.

hd_dropeverythingondeath: HD mostly goes with regular Doom inventory behaviour when dying and respawning: you keep your stuff in co-op, reset your stuff in deathmatch, maybe drop an extra copy of your weapon. Enabling this cvar will cause you to drop *all* your inventory except keys, leaving a stash of loot for your opponents (or buddies) in deathmatch or, in co-op, forcing you to do a naked walk of shame back to where you'd died.  Default false.

hd_safelifts: With HD's reduced player speed and falling damage, some classic Doom lifts end up creating scenarios that resemble a superimposition of a Simone Giertz comedy routine and the deposition materials from a factory class action suit. HD automatically scales all these lifts at level start to more reasonable speeds. This may break some levels, so this option is provided. Note that the level must be restarted for the changes to take effect. Default true.

hd_dirtywindows: Before limit-removing sourceports the only windows in Doom were wholly see-through, even if they were supposed to block absolutely everything. This can be a bit frustrating when you have no idea what your shots can or cannot go through unimpeded. This setting will overlay all of these blocking surfaces with a translucent dirt texture to make them look like a poorly cleaned window. Default true.

hd_3speed: The frequently varying player speeds in HD do not play well with the movement prediction in network play. If you are experiencing an unusual amount of "rubber banding" while playing online, you can enable this option so that you are restricted to one of only 3 possible pre-set speeds at any time in multiplayer.

hd_debug: Turns on some debug logging messages and displays, such as damage reports and (at level 2) bullet trails. Default 0.

hd_clearscv: Resets all archived host options to their defaults.

	CVars (user-based)

hd_helptext (2): Some events (e.g., picking up a rifle variant, pulling the pin and lighting the fuze on a grenade) generate text messages on your screen that remind you of certain non-obvious events. By setting this cvar to zero, you turn those reminders off. At your own risk.
Set to 1 instead of 2 to get rid of the newbie tips that show up on map start.

hd_hudsprite (false): Displays your current weapon as a pickup sprite graphic inside your HUD, Ghost Recon-style. Always on when r_drawplayersprites is off.

hd_noscope (false): Many weapons have an optic sight that is represented as a sight picture just below HD's regular sight picture crosshair. If set to true, this will only appear with the full HUD or while you are holding Zoom.

hd_sightbob (true): HD's sight crosshairs by default will bob as the player moves. This can sometimes be useful for making trick shots, but for many it is more distracting than anything else. Turn this off to hide the entire thing when you're moving above a certain threshold. Note that your scope angle will still follow the bob which is still used to calculate the trajectory of your shot.

hd_xhairscale (1): HD's sight crosshairs can scale unpredictably at different resolutions. Other people just don't like the size. Use this setting to make adjustments. Values are between 0.1 and 3.0 inclusive and default is 1.

hd_crosshair (0): This affects which image is displayed on the ZM66 and Liberator reflex sights. This is applied on a per-user basis and you will not need to set this every time you pick up a new gun. If you want to modify these, the lumps to replace are "riflsit1" through "riflsit5".

hd_hudusedelay (12): This is how many tics you must hold Use before the full HUD shows up with all the ammo counts and compass (and scope view if hd_noscope is set to 1). Zero means it is always on. If below zero, your HUD disappears entirely, except only for your crosshair, when you are not pressing Use. At -2, even the crosshair disappears, but can be brought back with Zoom as well as Use.

hd_aimsensitivity (3): By default, when you hold the Use key your aim sensitivity is cranked down to 1/8 so you can do better long-distance shots. This option reduces that reduction to 1/4, 1/2 or no reduction at all.

hd_usefocus (true): Holding the Zoom key will normally reduce your aim sensitivity, subject to the hd_aimsensitivity setting. Normally the Use key will also cause this to happen, for the benefit of those who may be running low on room on their keyboards; if this is not a concern for you, or you find that the numerous functions of the Use key are clashing against each other, set this to false so that only the Zoom key will affect your aim.

hd_autostrip (false): Normally you must hit hd_strip to strip off your armour, or hit Reload with the medikit out. With this option enabled you will automatically strip when you hit fire or altfire.

hd_noslide (false): Normally if you hit Crouch while moving, you will dive/slide/lunge in that direction. This can be pretty useful to defend against certain attacks (or to inflict certain attacks) but it is bad for fine control and cover manipulation. Set this to true to just simply crouch for this input if you are not sprinting.

hd_clearucv: Resets all archived user options to their defaults.

	CVars (user-based): weapon default options

The following cvars affect how some of your weapons are set up when you first spawn with them in your loadout. Default setting in parentheses.

hd_derpmode (0): Sets the starting mode for the DERP. 1=turret; 2=ambush; 3=patrol.

hd_autoactivateied (true): If false, you have to manually activate your IEDs using the "ied 1 [tag]" command. If true, they activate after a 2-second warning period without any further input.

hd_pistauto, hd_smgfiremode, hd_zmfiremode, hd_libauto (0): Set semi or full automatic for the pistol, SMG, ZM66 and Liberator. 1=full auto for the rifles, but burst for the SMG. 2=burst for the ZM66, but full auto for the SMG.

hd_huntauto (0): Sets your Hunter to start pump, semi, or full-auto.

hd_huntfullauto (false): Turn on to enable the Hunter full-auto hack.

hd_vulcsuper (0): If set to 1, starts in 2100 RPM mode rather than 700.

hd_zmzoom, hd_vulczoom, hd_libzoom (varies): Starts with the ZM66, Vulcanette and Liberator scope at various zoom levels, up to a maximum of 27 for the ZM66 and Vulcanette and 32 for the Liberator.

hd_rlzoom, hd_brontozoom (false): Starts with the rocket launcher and the Brontornis using the magnified view with the stadia lines. Useful mostly for engagements well over 50m.

hd_rlmode (0): If set to 1, starts in grenade rather than rocket mode. If set to 2, you lose 1 loaded rocket and start with a HEAT loaded instead.

hd_tbmode (0): If set to 1, starts the Thunder Buster in its alternate CQB spray setting.

hd_libmoa (30), hd_bossmoa (27): Presets the reticle bullet drop adjustment. See the individual weapon descriptions in this manual for details.

hd_bosszoom (0): Starts with the Boss scope at various zoom levels, up to a maximum of 55.

hd_bosscustomchamber (false): If true, your starting Boss rifle is a fancy custom with a special loose-tolerance action that doesn't gum up as easily and jams significantly less often even with minimal maintenance work. This sacrifices a bit of the extreme power of the Boss, but it should still hit harder per bullet than the Liberator.

hd_libfrontreticle, hd_bossfrontreticle (false): If true, your rifle scope is fitted with a front reticle that follows the magnification of your target. This means the dots are consistent with the adjustments you need to make, but the resulting range of possible magnifications is much smaller.

hd_clearwepcv: Resets all archived weapon options to their defaults.


All the above cvars can be changed in ZDoom's gameplay options menu.



	   V. ITEMS

To pick up an item, use it as you would use a door or switch, or hold Use and look and move towards it. Even if you do not pick it up, you will bring it towards yourself, so this can also be done to get an unwanted item out of the way of another (or an actual door or switch) that you do want.

Armour comes in two flavours: military green and militarized-police/unaccountable non-state-actor corporate "civilian" blue. Blue mitigates the most damage, while green lasts longer generally. All armour restricts movement very slightly, with the encumbrance increasing with more powerful protection.

Supernatural health bonuses (potions, soul spheres, megaspheres) are stored and gradually "leak" into your system whenever you are injured, allowing recovery from nearly anything that does not immediately kill you.

Some items can be picked up and saved for later, as described below.

Stimpack
GZDoom actor name: PortableStimpack
Use one of these to kickstart your system, decreasing your recovery time while slowing down your bleeding.
DANGER: DO NOT OVERDOSE.

Medikit
GZDoom actor name: PortableMedikit
Weapon slot: 9
The staple (no pun intended) bit of safety equipment once prevention has failed. You will find in each sealed package:
1. One (1) sterile, single-use Nano-Bio-Fusion Auto-Suture medical stapler loaded with... let's just say enough auto-sutures to do the job;
2. One (1) sterile, single-use Hyper-Expansive Bio-Foam injector (specially designed for bullet and other puncture wounds) loaded with... well, again, NDA and all, I can't really say; and
3. Two (2) doses of Second Flesh(tm) Human Biotic Rapid Growth Medium. (They didn't even brief me on the NDA for this, I couldn't even pronounce the ingredients.)
To use, remove armour and unseal one package.
Once the applicator is in hand, look down at yourself and press and hold the fire button to begin applying items 1 and 2 (automatically applied as necessary) to stop virtually any bleeding.
If lasting injuries or burns require treatment, press alternate fire similarly to apply the Second Flesh(tm).
To switch between using on yourself and using on others, use the Zoom key.
Hit the fire mode key to use the medikit's auto-diagnostic function. Try not to move while it is scanning. The scan *can* be done while wearing armour but accuracy suffers as a result.
WARNING: Do NOT attempt to apply the Second Flesh(tm) while in combat. Retreat to a secure position first!
WARNING: DO NOT USE THE SAME APPLICATOR ON MULTIPLE PATIENTS. (Seriously, if half of what your buddies say about their R&R exploits were true...)

Berserk Pack
GZDoom actor name: PortableBerserkPack
It doesn't quite make your punch ten times as strong, but when you've got more monsters than time to reload, this thing is a godsend. The burst of strength also lets you carry heavy weapons more efficiently. The effect only lasts a very short while, so use it while you've got it!
Its original "on-label" use was to save someone going into shock or cardiac arrest, though it was found that sometimes it made things worse after it wore off.

Light Amplification Visor
GZDoom actor name: PortableLiteAmp
Use to turn on and off. Requires at least one operational battery in your inventory to use.

Ladder
GZdoom actor name: PortableLadder
Use while on a ledge (above or below) to deploy.
From below, stand as close to the ledge as possible and look right into the wall.
From above, look at the ledge you want to hang the ladder from.
Press use to engage the ladder. To disengage, do any of the following:
- press jump at any time (which will also give you a horizontal boost away from the ladder).
- press use again while turned away from it, or while directly facing it.
- press speed while standing about on the top ledge from which you have hung the ladder.
To remove the ladder, get onto the ladder and attempt to jump while crouching.

Radiation Shielding Suit
GZDoom actor name: PortableRadSuit
Doubles as a fire retardant suit. Lasts until damaged.
Protip: The suit heats up pretty fast. Keep moving to keep it from stewing in its own gases and igniting.

Backpack
GZDoom actor name: HDBackpack
Use from inventory to bring it up. Fire and altfire select your item; hold fire mode to momentarily use your pitch input instead. Reload places one unit of the selected item type into it, unload takes it out. Mash the Zoom key to dump out all the contents of the backpack. The drop-one key works to remove ammo from your own inventory in case you want to make a little more space.

Defence, Engagement, Reconnaissance and Patrol Robot
GZDoom actor name: DERPBot
The gun that runs around killing people by itself! Basically a pistol wired to a webcam and treads, made of bullets, aggression and shitty programmer art. Must be manually recovered after use. They can't climb and run out of ammo quickly, but you can pick them back up anytime as you would an ordinary item for later redeployment. Uses up one pistol mag each time you deploy, and any unused ammo is recovered on pickup.
If it breaks, you will not be able to use it again until you start a new level.
The DERP can be programmed to one of several behaviours. Type the following into the console, or "derp <number shown>", to set what mode it will engage in at any time.
	1. derpt = TURRET: Stand ground and engage targets from wherever it is.
	2. derpa = AMBUSH: As turret, but will not shoot.
	3. derpp = PATROL: Wander around the vicinity of its goal, pursue and engage targets as acquired.
	4. derpcome: make a beeline towards the user.
	5. derpgo: make a beeline towards the general direction you are pointing in.
	6. derpat: toggle between turret and ambush mode.
	80*. derpmv*: make a beeline towards a spot several feet ahead in a cardinal direction. For the derpmv command, this means n/s/e/w/ne/sw/se/sw; for the number, look at your numpad.
"derp" in the above can be shortened to "d", e.g. "dtz" for ambush mode, but not if you use the numbers. Typing "derp" only, or entering an unused number, will show these commands.
Type "derp 123" to show coordinates and ammo.
An additional, somewhat off-label use is to stick the treads onto the moving parts of a switch and use the DERP to operate it while the user is out of reach. Type "derp 555 <tag>" in the console to place it and "derp 556 <tag>" to set it off.

Heavy Engagement Rotary Platform Robot
GZDoom actor name: HERPBot
In the wake of the stunning success of the D.E.R.P. project, the Brojira Robotics and Human Development Foundation soon secured a second grant from the Israeli military to build a scaled-up version for high-accuracy automated targeting in heavy urban engagements. This was met with some setbacks early on in the project when it was discovered that Brojira's CEO at the time, Dr. Branson Icke, had supported a local mayoral candidate in his hometown eight years before whose platform included "ending the politically correct war on Christmas by passing a bylaw that every mall Santa shall be a real Santa with HIS beard and HIS wife Mrs. Claus who is a woman". A great and terrible media cycle ensued and Dr. Icke, one of the chief coders and designers behind the original D.E.R.P. project, was forced to resign from all further positions with Brojira, and the H.E.R.P. project was substantially completed without his guidance and programming virtuosity. The resulting product remains functional, if a bit bloated, slow and unwieldy.
Once deployed, the HERP will begin doing sweeps of the 90-degree view in front of its starting position. The new IFF detection system* means it can only focus on a narrow band in front of it, meaning that it will only target enemies that cross the sensor line.
*(which contains a few additional safeguards after numerous class action lawsuits resulting from fatalities when local American police forces were found to be deploying units in inner-city schools)
The HERP takes up to 3 mags and 1 cell to deploy.
The HERP is bulky enough to count as its own weapon when encumbrance limits are enabled.
You can manipulate your HERPs from the console.
Command format: herp <mode> <tag> <direction>
Possible modes are:
1 = On: scan for enemies and shoot on sight
2 = Off: stand by and do nothing
3 = Redirect: change base angle by the amount given in the direction parameter, going counterclockwise in degrees.
123 = Query: show coordinates, orientation and status
-x = Set tag: where x is any whole number
For more information on tags, please see the IED Kit description.

Door Buster
GZDoom actor name: DoorBuster
Some military-grade demolition charges, because doors are a social construct.
Please do not stand directly in front of the blast shell when it detonates.
Command format: db <option> <tag>
Possible options:
999 = Detonate
123 = Query
-x = Set tag ("dbtag <tag>" also works)

IED Kit
GZDoom actor name: HDIEDKit
The OpenTerror Working Group's brief lifespan included what turned out to be an ingenious adaptation of the Heckler & Mok Short-Range Reduced-Arc Hybrid Rocket Grenade for securing a building against certain passing threats. The open-source schematics have allowed numerous aftermarket companies to develop the Simple Idiotproof Improvised Explosive Device Kit for various military, police and private security contracts long after the original inventors were captured, tortured and their remains presumably disposed of in an undisclosed location by various government and other* agencies. (*A lawsuit against Heckler & Mok by the families was dismissed with costs after an eighteen-day motion was heard. The families settled for an undisclosed amount and were never heard from again.)
To activate the IED, make sure you have at least one IED kit and one live or dud rocket. (You can pick duds up from any botched grenade launch assuming they don't spontaneously detonate on you first.) The IED takes 5 seconds to come online, during which you may decide to flee. They will generally not target friendlies. An IED may be picked up and its components reused; the disarming process, however, ruins the rocket grenade such that it can no longer be launched and is only good for planting another IED.
You can manipulate your IEDs from the console.
Command format: ied <mode> <tag>
Possible modes are:
1 = Active: detonate once an enemy is in range
2 = Passive: detonate only when commanded
999 = Detonate: detonate immediately
123 = Query: show coordinates and status
-x = Set tag
"iedactive", "iedpassive" and "detonate" can be used in place of "ied 1", "ied 2" and "ied 999" and can all take tags.
Tags help you sort IEDs into groups. The tag number appears in cyan in your inventory selection: that is the tag of any IED you deploy next. If you set Active, Passive, Detonate or Query and specify a tag, only those deployed IEDs of yours that have that specific tag will be affected.
Example: I type "ied -2" and plant an IED by the door, then type "ied -3" and plant another IED down the hall, then run for cover and type "ied 2" to set all the IEDs to passive. The door opens and some monsters come through the door, and as they pass the door IED I type "ied 999 2". The door IED blasts a bunch of them, and the survivors continue down the hall. They reach the second IED, I type "ied 999 3" (or "ied 999" since I don't have anything else deployed anyway) and that IED blows up those survivors.

Relic of the Ancients
GZDoom actor name: SquadSummoner
Not all the magics that escaped through the gates are evil, or at least not all of them are specifically out to get you. Every so often you may run into an ancient piece of arms and armour that serves as a talisman to bring back the spirits of long-departed warriors to aid your quest - if only for a little while. Their damage is almost entirely illusory, but they can be very useful for routing and isolating an otherwise overwhelming force.

Four-Dimensional Ring of Shadows
GZdoom actor name: HDBlurSphere
This one is not out to get you. It cannot be; it is precious. Use it early and often to get out of bad things and stop bad people from looking at you and hurting you. You will only ever need one. It is precious.

Potion of Goodness
GZDoom actor name: BluePotion
Another supernatural artifact of questionably non-Hellish origin. Heals you over time. In fact, it can "over-heal" you so that if you're hurt later, you can recover faster because of your prior drinking! (Please do not apply this logic to other bottled materials that some people use in lieu of actual spiritual healing.)

Spiritual Armour
GZDoom actor name: SpiritualArmour
Another supernatural artifact of even more questionably non-Hellish origin. Stops any and all bleeding on the spot and grants you additional protection from damage.

Suspiciously Generic Ammo Box
GZDoom actor name: HDAmBox, HDAmBoxUnarmed, HDAmBoxDisarmed, HDAB
These ammo boxes are actually full of ammo, though they may also contain other lovely surprises. To disarm the trap, tap use once to attempt to disarm. You will automatically flip disarmed boxes over to mark them as checked. Rapidly double-tap use on the box to open it immediately without completing the trap check. Not all boxes are trapped in such a way as to allow disarm, and you may want to shoot them open from a safe distance instead.



	 VI. LIVES

If you set the fraglimit to certain values in a multiplayer game, you can play a last-man- or last-team-standing deathmatch game, or play co-op without the temptation to send wave after wave of yourself into the enemy until they eventually thin out.

Only the host needs to set the fraglimit. You must allow exits for the level end to work.

Generally: FL less than 100 = points; FL 100 or over = elimination.

Deathmatch FL <100: Same as usual.

FFA Deathmatch FL >=100:
- Each player has a number of lives equal to fraglimit less 100.
- If you run out of lives, next time you die you are out and respawn frozen and unable to interact.
- Last person still alive is deemed to win the match.

Team Deathmatch FL >=100:
- Each team has a pool of lives equal to fraglimit less 100.
- If your team runs out of lives, next time you die you are out and respawn frozen and unable to interact.
- Last team with at least one surviving member is deemed to win the match.

Co-op FL <=0:
- There is no lives pool, and you respawn infinitely subject to your usual dmflags.

Co-op FL >=100:
- All players share a single lives pool, equal to fraglimit less 100.
- If you run out of lives, next time you die you are out and respawn as a spectator.
- If everyone is out, the game over message appears and the map restarts after a few seconds.
- "Outed" players' loadouts are reset.

Co-op FL <100:
- All players share a single lives pool, equal to fraglimit.
- If you run out of lives, the game over message appears and the map restarts after a few seconds.
- If you manage to die during these few seconds, you are out as in FL <100.
- "Outed" players' loadouts are reset.



	VII. WEAPONS


Unarmed

GZDoom actor name: HDFist
Default weapon slot: 1

Description: Punching people and things.

Instructions: Fire button is a straight-up punch. Altfire lunges forward. Reload performs a finger-jab-hook combo. Hold the Use key to start kicking someone in front of you. You are assumed to be trying to cause maximum damage with every attack and it will only take a few hits to take down weaker enemies.

Note that the use key kick is available with any weapon.

The unload button lets you flick a small piece of debris in the direction you are looking. This can be useful for causing a distraction or hitting a shootable switch. You can collect debris by punching walls; if you don't have debris, you'll generate your own.

Protip: Punching damage responds to the way you are turning at the time your fist connects. A good left hook or uppercut to the head can knock out a zombie in one punch. In any event, headshots are generally good for knocking someone about to keep them from hitting back. (Their not hitting back is not guaranteed.)


Chainsaw

GZDoom actor name: Lumberjack
Default weapon slot: 1

Description: A small, rugged chainsaw.

Instructions: Press fire to cut things. Eats cell power like popcorn; reload as any other weapon.

Hold altfire and point up while the chainsaw is off to raise it. Release fire to smash it down into whatever's in front of you for a surprising amount of damage.

Protip: This, berserk fist and explosives are the only remotely efficient ways to gib corpses. Keep changing your angle and distance as you cut as the blade will slip out of position from time to time.


Pistol

GZDoom actor name: HDPistol
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD9mMag15, HDPistolAmmo
Default weapon slot: 2

Description: With its compact high-capacity design and extremely powerful 9mm Magnum round, the Mouletta 99FX has followed and surpassed the tradition of its forebears as the standard complement to any arsenal. There was also a limited production of a full-auto variant that may occasionally be found as a PDW.

Instructions: Press the fire button to further your effort to bust as many caps in your target's body part of choice as possible. Fire mode works if you have the lucky pistol that allows it.

While both the pistol and the SMG use the same rounds, the magazines are not cross-compatible. Hit the user3 button to load and unload mags.

The pistol's reload time is possibly the fastest of all the weapons, but you can shave off even that split second by carrying 2, dropping your first as it empties and drawing the other. To swap pistols without dropping, use alt reload or (if the current pistol cannot or need not be chambered manually) altfire.

Protip: The pistol does not count, or counts only nominally, for many of HD's mobility checks against weapons. It is ideal for close combat where you're too panicked or immobilized to land a proper punch.


SMG

GZDoom actor name: HDSMG
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD9mMag30, HDPistolAmmo
Default weapon slot: 2

Description: The Heckler and Mok MP-46 heavy automatic pistol - nicknamed the "Sexy Manly Guy" in reference to a rather untimely scandal involving one of the company's directors (then a senator) who was supervising the development, an 18-year-old male intern, allegations of insider trading, an unidentified leather object found with some early prototype drawings and some saucy emails revealed during a deposition - fills that niche where a rifle is too noisy and unwieldy, a shotgun is too bulky and lethal, and a pistol just can't hit fast or far enough. Mostly bought by collectors and casing-loving hipsters, as well as law enforcement looking for a weapon with less kick and noise than the ZM66 but better suppressive capability (both tactical and PR-strategic) for use while keeping us all safe from alleged drug dealers and their alleged drug money.

Instructions: Press and hold the fire button to further your effort to bust as many caps in your target's body part of choice as possible. Use the fire mode key to switch between semi, burst and full-auto. Note that the order is different between the MP-46 and the ZM66 due to conflicting manufacturing standards.

As with the pistol, hit the user3 button to load and unload mags.

Protip: The SMG is quieter than the pistol. It is the best stealth weapon over beating someone over the head with an unpowered chainsaw!


Shotgun

GZDoom actor name: Hunter
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDShellAmmo
Default weapon slot: 3

Description: The DiFranco SPOS-E28 scattergun is easily the most widespread firearm in known space. Formerly marketed as the "Man-Hunter" before the liberals got the name banned in eleven states after a spate of shooting sprees, the Hunter's reliability, (relative) safety while firing in pressurized quarters, and ability to take just about any ammo given to it are unsurpassed by any current weapon. Also good for home defence and hunting big game - up close.

The Tyrant has been strangely fond of this weapon and has armed most of his zombies with it; while officially Metallian Holdings Ltd. (DiFranco's parent company) denies any dealings with the Tyrant or any of his known dealers, or in the alternative at least having ever profited from such transactions, or in the further alternative having ever received any such funds from DiFranco, unofficially we all know there's no such thing as bad publicity.

It is extremely illegal in most states, and under the rules set by the Tyrant, to modify the SPOS-E28 to remove the safety features in its trigger mechanism as to allow continuous fire with fully automatic cycling.

Instructions: Altfire cycles the next round; make sure you press hard and long enough that the round actually cycles. Primary fire is what you do to something until it dies.

Holding down the trigger while you chamber a new round lets you slam-fire the shotgun, firing the round immediately when it is ready to fire. Semiauto disables this.

To stop reloading earlier, hold on to the reload key until you hear the click of the loading port closing.

To reload quickly from the shotgun's side saddles, press the reload key. To slowly fish a shell or two from somewhere in your pockets to load those, press the secondary reload key. To reload the side saddles, hit the reload key while the Hunter itself is full, or while holding the fire mode key.

If you hit reload and unload while the pump is pulled back, you will reload and unload the chamber.

To change fire mode, hit the fire mode key. There is no guarantee as to the quality of the ammo you find and not every round may be strong enough to cycle properly, so altfire is still available to force cycle a round if necessary.

If you have the Slayer, pressing Unload while holding Use or Zoom will remove up to 4 shells at a time from its side saddles and place them in your general inventory.

Protip: People will develop personal preferences for pump or auto and it's probably best to train and stick with one.


Super Shotgun

GZDoom actor name: Slayer
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDShellAmmo
Default weapon slot: 3

Description: Accurate, ergonomic and compact, deceptively primitive yet rugged enough to withstand anything the bad guys might ever think to throw at you, the ambidextrously designed Calvary Arms SL41 "Slayer" side-by-side is an instant classic among big game hunters throughout the solar system. Big, armoured, bipedal game.

Instructions: Each of fire and altfire represents the trigger for one barrel. You can fire them in as rapid a succession as you want, even simultaneously.

If you want to ensure a double every time, hold fire mode and tap either fire button.

When you reload, both shells eject at once, even if only one shell has been fired. Provided you are in good health, have space in your inventory, and (if you are distracted by anything less than near-perfect health) aren't moving about at the same time, you should be able to catch the unspent shell; otherwise, you must find out where it's dropped.

Secondary reload works in a similar manner to the Hunter. Side saddles work identically.

If you have the Hunter, pressing Unload while holding Use or Zoom will remove up to 4 shells at a time from its side saddles and place them in your general inventory.

Protip: Protip: For a quick double, tap the sprint key to momentarily lower the Slayer, then hold on to both fire buttons to shoot both barrels at once.


Assault Rifle

ZDoom actor names: ZM66AssaultRifle
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD4mMag, HDRocketAmmo
Default weapon slot: 4

Description: The basic infantryman's weapon of the 22nd century. A very lightweight select-fire weapon that fires up to 2100 rounds per minute, the Volt ZM66 represents the highest evolution of its state-of-the-art ammunition. As a refinement of the principles behind the old 5.56 NATO, the 4.26mm UAC Standard round packs an incredible amount of punch for its size. The 4.26mm UAC Standard round is protected by a special non-terminating legislative patent and a 99-year automatically renewed confidential exclusive contract with the militaries of all developed Western nations worth mentioning, guaranteeing a safe and reliable supply.

To get around prior overheating issues with the caseless 4.26mm round, the ZM66 chamber and barrel are lined with a patented heat-sink polymer that contracts when placed under extreme stress and heat, returning to its original form after having a chance to cool down. This reduces friction with subsequent bullets and allows for vastly increased tolerance thresholds that let the ZM66 continue firing where most rifles will have broken down. This temporary warping sacrifices some accuracy and power under sustained fire, but if you're in that spray-and-pray situation to begin with, chances are you won't even notice it. [a handwritten note reads: or the ensuing cookoff.]

You may occasionally find some old variants of the ZM66 that were made for the civilian market shortly before private consumer assault weapon bans were prohibited by treaty in all APEC nations thanks to the efforts of many freedom-loving lobbyists back home, sponsored by the Volt Strategic Systems Group (and the 2/3 of Congress that have sat in their and UAC's various boards of directors). Some people actually prefer the semi variant for its reportedly greater reliability, though numerous UAC-sponsored independent reviews have found no evidence for it.

The ZM66 has a telescopic sight with a backup dot on top.

The ZM66 may be fitted with an underslung grenade launcher capable of taking the Heckler & Mok Short-Range Reduced-Arc Hybrid Rocket Grenade; however, for safety reasons the launcher is designed only to fire in grenade mode.

Instructions: Press the fire button to shoot, altfire to switch to and from the grenade launcher.

The scope can be adjusted by holding Zoom and Firemode, and using either aim up/down or the fire and altfire buttons.

The grenade does not arm for the first 15 feet or so. While usually firing at close range would leave you with a dud grenade, there is no guarantee the projectile will not arm and detonate at some later point!

Reload key reloads the rifle. Alternate reload reloads the grenade launcher. If you are using the rifle and it is jammed, press reload to try to clear the jam.

Tap fire mode when using the rifle to cycle through semi, fullauto and 3-round burst. When using the grenade launcher, hold fire mode and press fire and altfire to program airburst as with the dedicated grenade/rocket launchers.

When you switch to the rifle from any other weapon, you're set to shoot the rifle not the grenade launcher. This is NOT the case with the rocket launcher which remembers your setting.

Protip: Do not hit Reload at just the right time as the message comes up. Doing so is illegal.


Rotary Support Weapon

GZDoom actor name: Vulcanette
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD4mMag
Default weapon slot: 4

Description: At the same time as the ZM66's development, the UAC was experimenting with its own designs for a 4.26 Standard support weapon. One method of overcoming the heat issue was to cycle multiple barrels at slightly looser tolerances, which led to the UAC Standard Mk. III "Vulcanette".

Thus far no stable single-barrel 4.26 SAW design capable of sustained full-auto fire has been found, and the Vulcanette model remains in production today throughout the solar system. Despite its bulk, it provides an advanced but rugged and durable support weapon heavy enough to manage its own recoil with enough heat radiating from its greater surface area to allow limited support fire in space. And it's pretty intimidating-looking, to boot.

Instructions: Use the fire mode key to switch between 700 RPM and 2100 RPM. The higher firing rate is unavailable when your battery power is low (around the last notch of the indicator).

When the active mag has run out, the Vulcanette will automatically cycle the next mag. When unloading the weapon, you will unload, in descending order of priority: the second mag in the queue (and bringing up the remaining mags to replace it); the active mag; the cell.

Use the alternate reload key to load a cell. One cell will provide for about 2000 rounds' worth of shots.

Protip: Berserk helps significantly when dealing with the Vulcanette's weight.


Rocket Launcher

GZDoom actor name: HDRL
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDRocketAmmo, HEATAmmo
Default weapon slot: 5

Description: The Heckler and Mok Urban Artillery series was developed as a response to a growing need for more powerful but more containable infantry firepower for fighting in built-up areas. While the grenade launcher still prevails in ease of use and responsiveness, sometimes one simply hasn't the luxury of arcing a grenade under the low ceilings of a rebel base. The patented Short-Range Reduced-Arc Hybrid Rocket Grenade combines the functions of both RPG and fragmentation grenade in a single neat, deadly, digital precise package.

(There was some brief scandal in the People's Republic of China when illegal foreign-funded underground media sources reported extensive use of this technology in a brutal suppression of a student protest in a gathering place now known as Anquanmen (安圈門, Peaceful Circle Gate) which also allegedly involved numerous people being scalded to death with some unremembered weapon. Official sources say that the current Chairman, the Head that controls the Socialist People's Institute of Co-ordinated Experiments, has scientifically established that only the criminals of the worst sort were neutralized there in an emergency and no students were harmed. However, astute readers would also note that certain unrelated rumours about a "successor head" crisis in the S.P.I.C.E. (colloquially referred to as 替光頭gate) in the preceding months were also very quickly silenced following the incident.)

Instructions: Press fire to launch a rocket. The rocket will arm and accelerate about 14 metres away, and drop as it travels.

Altfire switches to and from grenade mode, as with the rifle's underslung grenade launcher.

The zoom function is limited to rocket mode only and cannot be adjusted. Hold Zoom and tap Firemode to switch between the magnified and the regular sights.

Reloading the launcher works the same way as reloading the Hunter, except the launcher can only hold five rockets plus the chamber.

To set the airburst distance, hold down the fire mode key and use fire and altfire to increase and decrease time accordingly (zero being no airburst). This setting is reset every time you shoot, switch between grenade and rocket mode, or load/unload a HEAT round. The number is in metres of total distance travelled by the rocket grenade (NOT horizontal distance from your target).

You may occasionally run into high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rockets that can be loaded into the launcher. These are oversize and once loaded you cannot cycle through the magazine, so it must be used or unloaded before you may use normal rockets again. To load one, hit the alternate reload key; to unload it, hit that key again or the reload key. Any already chambered rocket will be unloaded and pocketed or dropped depending on space in your inventory.

Protip: When the rocket is fired as a grenade, it contains some unused propellant which can cause serious burns in addition to the blast damage. However, the grenade also lacks the direct impact damage that a rocket can do at greater distances, damaging some targets that can otherwise shrug off an explosion. The bigger the target and the longer the range, the more likely a rocket would be preferable to a grenade.


Grenade Launcher

GZDoom actor name: Blooper
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDRocketAmmo
Default weapon slot: 5

Description: Eventually demand for a simpler, more portable weapon compatible with the new standard Short-Range Reduced-Arc Hybrid Rocket Grenade resulted in the production of a much simpler weapon from previous centuries. Name and all, it seems.

Instructions: Press fire to launch a grenade. As with the rocket launcher, the fire mode key let you program airburst. There is no rocket mode, but altfire can still be used to quickly reset the airburst.

Protip: The blooper takes slightly longer to load than it takes to load a single rocket into the rocket launcher.


Pulsed Particle Beam Projector

GZDoom actor name: ThunderBuster
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDBattery
Default weapon slot: 6

Description: In recent years Heckler & Mok were going through their typical occasional experimental infantry energy weapons research kick. Their latest casualty of common sense is the Atmospheric Mk.XI "Thunder Buster", an adaptation of the big phased particle beam cannons found in large Bishop-class high-orbital patrollers. It is indeed a fine and powerful weapon, but nonetheless based on something shooting through space at massive inanimate objects with highly predictable trajectories. For want of any commercial application they somehow sold the specs to the UAC at an exorbitant price, officially as part of a settlement amid accusations of corporate espionage and stealing of trade secrets in UAC's old, officially scrapped Martian weapons project.

Instructions: Press and hold fire to shoot the beam. The beam must be focussed on a single spot until you see the plasma ball. Keep holding the beam there - you'll know when something has happened. Warning: For best results, only engage targets more than 20 metres and less than 200 metres away.

Press fire mode or altfire to activate the "hacked" version of the Thunder Buster which breaks the beam into a scattered, chaotic mess that does not (usually) trigger the critical explosion but causes much more damage to everything overall. This is extremely energy inefficient, but oddly cathartic.

Protip: The Thunder Buster's beam destabilizes shields.


Battle Rifle

ZDoom actor names: LiberatorRifle
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD7mMag, SevenMilAmmo
Default weapon slot: 6

Description: Back before the days of the ZM66, the Volt-Shepard Arms Group (at the time independent of UAC) had in limited production an extremely durable, almost jam-free long-range automatic rifle chambered for its 7.76mm full-power cased round that could be produced by virtually anyone. A few government contracts, failed bids and five US Supreme Court appeals resolved against Volt-Shepard later (all 5/4 splits along Democrat/Republican lines and despite extensive advocacy by several military intervenors) the UAC Standard was fully recognized and the Volt-Shepard companies were subject to an immediate hostile takeover by UAC. During the chaos Heckler & Mok bought the rights to the patent, rebranded it as the "ZM7 Liberator", and made a killing selling it at a huge markup to people who resented the state-sponsored UAC/Volt near-monopoly over their right to bear arms. A vague rumour on the Internet that the government was going to ban future production to regulate the copper supply and/or prevent future spree killings (a murderer would not be stopped by a jam or overheat!) also helped sales.

Today a few are still made for the civilian market and can be found among special forces personnel from Canada and several African states. Its biggest drawback, besides market share, is cost: the rate of barrel foulings, breakages and jams more than quintuples if the casings are not made from real brass rather than ordinary plastic or steel.

Instructions: As with the ZM66 unless noted otherwise. There is no 3-round burst, the idea being that the much more powerful 7.76mm round should be enough without the spray-and-pray often encouraged by the burst function.

Hit the user3 button to load and unload mags.

The scope can be adjusted by holding Zoom and Firemode, and using either aim up/down or the fire and altfire buttons. You can similarly adjust bullet drop compensation by holding Zoom and Use; a value of 120 is roughly the entire length of HD's firing range.

Protip: Every Liberator and Boss has a portable reloading kit built into its stock. Your ZM66 tactical reloads will leave you with a lot of unreliable caseless powder and lead. Firing the Liberator leaves a lot of cases without powder or lead, while one of the official reasons the Volt-Shepard 7.76mm was not adopted was due to its lack of frangibility. The game environment is full of things that can grind or melt things. The reuse of a partial 4.26mm UAC Standard mag is illegal, but really, the worst Volt UAC's impious counsel can do is drag you in front of The Honourable Mr. Justice Rotting-Head-On-A-Stick and his clerk Mrs. Caco, and as a natural person you don't recognize their jurisdiction.

If you have a Liberator (or a Boss), you will be assumed to figure out what to do in the downtime between levels.


BFG9K

GZDoom actor name: BFG9K
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDBattery
Default weapon slot: 7

Description: An attempt to merge conventional human technology with the power of the Anomalies before the invasion of Phobos, the Botis Field Glyph, Mark 9 was part a greater work that would have made Union Aerospace the single biggest player in the energy market for centuries.

Unluckily for them, the proposed energy source caused the rout of civilization and the massacre of mankind - with the resulting lawsuits likely to result in a slightly smaller profit than imagined. Luckily for you, the weaponized "Kurz" version of the device is just small enough for one space marine to carry and deliver the horror the horror back to the enemy.

Background: The BFG works by drawing into itself the unexplained energies of the Anomalies. According to the UAC's internal documents*, the Botis fields were discovered by Dr. Graf Botis in a freak particle beam weapons testing accident on Mars, while Deimos was directly overhead. The field appeared to generate some kind of plasma-like or energy-like substance that seemed to behave alternately like a gas and a subatomic particle. Unable to properly characterize it, it was mentioned in Dr. Botis' notes as "Gretchenfrage" as a placeholder pending further study. (This was shortened in later notes to "Frage" and eventually "Frag" in common anglophone parlance.)

Under certain conditions (Dr. Botis found the shape and alignment of the lab to be a major factor) it was discovered that Botis fields could be used to recharge power cells almost indefinitely, as though time itself were being reversed; Union Aerospace kept the specifics substantially out of the public eye for years while trillions were diverted to energy research and an entire infrastructure was built with the Anomalies as their heart - and subsequent discovery of large-scale teleportation near and between the Anomalies, on top of the clean, renewable energy source, surpassed the wildest dreams of researchers and executives alike.

*Leaked by a rogue articled student during discovery in one of many class action suits following the invasion (with the result that residents of Denmark, Ghana, Wyoming and the city of Kelowna were unable to recover against UAC or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates under any proceedings respecting these invasions). Nothing is known about where this student went afterwards.

Instructions: The BFG needs the equivalent of 40 cell power units (i.e., 2 cell packs) to fire. The BFG has a built-in cell that cannot be removed, plus space for one removable one; either of these must have at least 30% power to start the charge sequence. To charge it up, simply press fire and remain in an area where there is an influx of Frag. (After the invasion, that means just about anywhere.) You can stop the charging process at its earlier stages by hitting the reload button, and you get to keep what charge you've already accrued. Note that as a side effect of its Hellish nature, the BFG may drain your life energies while you're already under stress (i.e., to exacerbate already low health). This may be an asset (faster charge) or a liability (higher risk).

Once you've got your charge built up, hold the fire key for a second or so to fire. The fire sequence requires a final few moments of charging, after which the Frag will attain critical mass and the firing process will become irreversible. After about a second you will see a large globule of green goo emanating from the BFG, which will then spontaneously send out tendrils to attack hostiles as it travels along its serpentine path.

Reloading the BFG works the same way as for the particle beam gun. You are assumed to load and charge the BFG to full capacity in the downtime between maps.

Use alternate reload to load a completely depleted cell into the BFG. If the BFG's internal cell is charged, it can be used to charge the depleted cell.

There is a slight momentary green glow as a charged cell is removed; leaked UAC studies confirm this is not a sign of radioactivity and exposure to this light will not hurt you. By repeatedly charging and unloading, you can soon replenish all your cell ammunition.

To improve accuracy, it is recommended that one deploy the recoil suppression harness on the BFG's stock. Press altfire to put it on and take it off.

Protip: Long shots beat point blank, as the ball gets more time to launch secondary attacks at hostiles before exploding.


Cannon

GZDoom actor name: Brontornis
GZDoom ammo actor names: BrontornisRound
Default weapon slot: 7

Description: The Freeley "Brontornis" series Mk.VII Ultralight Cannon was one of the candidates for the military's Urban Artillery project, ultimately losing out to Heckler & Mok's bid for its versatility and wide-area firepower. It fires a heavy, non-self-propelled 35mm hi-ex anti-materiel/incendiary round (colloquially known as a "bolt") that can punch through most hard targets while remaining highly effective at decisively neutralizing soft targets on impact (colloquially known as "gibbing people").

In the post-invasion paradigm, where surprise teleportations of heavily armoured infantry units into sensitive populated areas is a routine enemy tactic and there is a renewed interest in concentrated, maneuverable firepower in urban combat regularly blurring the line between anti-personnel and anti-materiel, the Freeley Intellectual Properties Group have announced plans on bringing the Brontornis back into full production but thus far supply has not met demand.

Instructions: Point, shoot, kill. Adjust for range in the rare event it is necessary as there is still an arc. Hit firemode or altfire to switch between the dot sight and the magnified stadia.

To ensure operator safety and comfort, the Brontornis cannon should only be fired from a secure position.

Protip: While it is too wide to penetrate walls effectively, the Brontornis shell is hard and can overpenetrate softer targets. Line them up.


Bolt-Action Rifle

ZDoom actor names: BossRifle
GZDoom ammo actor names: HD7mClip, SevenMilAmmo
Default weapon slot: 8

The Mk. IV Boss rifle is a deadly accurate weapon. Its long barrel, tighter reinforced chamber and manual action allow much greater muzzle velocity than an identical load in the Liberator. Its traditional action and extremely tight trigger allow pinpoint accuracy. The Boss rifle requires clean ammunition to prevent jamming. Good luck!

Instructions: Point, shoot, hope it dies. Altfire works the bolt, similar to the Hunter's pump. DO NOT SHORT STROKE.

Clip reload is only available to fill the entire mag, for reasons.

Hit the user3 button to load and unload clips.

When it jams, hold altfire to keep trying to unjam it. It's a little less finicky than the ZM66 that way.

If it's jamming more than it was before, you may need to clean some gunk out of the action. With the gun completely unloaded, hold altfire to pull the bolt back and and hit unload while pulled.

To load a single round directly into the chamber, hold altfire to pull the bolt back and hit reload while pulled.

Alternate reload strips a clip to get loose rounds (which then may be loaded individually into the Boss or used to fill a Liberator mag). If no clips are available, a Liberator magazine is cannibalized instead.

As with the other rifles, hold zoom and firemode or use to adjust scope zoom.

You can also adjust the bullet drop compensation, with fire mode instead of zoom. Zero means no adjustment and your shot will start parallel with your view.

The numbers on the screen read thus:
- the status bar displays the actual unit count by which you can make adjustments.
- the scope display is in 10ths of an arcminute, drop adjust on top and FOV on the bottom.
- every 2 drop adjust units should be one arcminute.
- if you are using a front plane reticle, one dot = 6 arcminutes.

Protip: It is nothing short of murder to send out men against the enemy with such a weapon. Find a Liberator.


Hand Grenade

GZDoom actor name: HDFragGrenades
GZDoom ammo actor names: HDFragGrenadeAmmo
Default weapon slot: 0

Description: The M67.1A fragmentation grenade hasn't changed much from its predecessors over the years. Pull the pin, drop the spoon, chuck it in a window, roll it along the floor, it blows up, everyone left standing is happy.

Instructions: Press and hold fire to set the force of the throw. A quick tap drops the grenade in front of your feet; a long hold risks bouncing the grenade off a wall back towards you (and possibly rolling well past you into safety, but don't assume that). If you've gone over the desired force, hit reload to put the pin back in and let go of the fire button once you hear the click to restart.

Hold altfire for just under a second to pull the pin. Once the pin has been pulled, you can throw it normally or press altfire again to release the spoon and begin the timer.

Grenades on the ground can be kicked out of the way by pressing use. This may save your life one day - or end it, timing being the secret to this as with any other comedy.

Grenade fuze delay is four seconds.

IED: Suppose you had some string and gum in your pocket. And a hand grenade. To use, hit Zoom while your frag grenades are out, and click on a wall to plant the gummed end of the string. Click again to plant the other end with the grenade. Congratulations on your new, probably treaty-contravening tripwire trap! To undo a tripwire trap, simply pick up the grenade as you normally would. If you walk slowly and carefully you *may* be able to safely step over some lower tripwires.

Protip: You can "fling" a hand grenade by turning as you let go, giving it the momentum of your turning movement - just like throwing a Pokéball (albeit without the curveballs). It is strongly recommended that you practice this on the range before attempting it in combat.

* NOTE TO MAPPERS: Please see "tripwires.txt" in the ZScript folder under actor name "TrippingFrag" for customizing individually placed tripwire grenades.



	VIII. MONSTERS


Stormtrooper

GZDoom actor name: ZombieStormtrooper, ZombieSemiStormtrooper, ZombieSMGStormtrooper
Replaces: ZombieMan

Description: "The green flash in the sky. His demons were here all along - in our hearts and souls - just waiting for a sign from him. And now they're destroying our world." Twisted and corrupted by the Hellish energies now uncontrollably pouring into this world, these shambling husks wander out to the front, hoping to infiltrate enemy lines and tenderize hostile forces a bit before the Tyrant's real army steamrolls its way in.

Protip: They dish out a lot more than they can take, so the one that kills you is rarely the one you see. Check all exits early and often and don't be shy about deploying your DERP bot.

* NOTE TO MAPPERS: Please see "zombieman.txt" in the ZScript folder for customizing individually placed zombies.


Jack-Booted Thug

GZDoom actor name: Jackboot, JackAndJillBoot, UndeadJackbootman
Replaces: ShotgunGuy

Description: "They carry their full context with them, self-contained, like a badge of honor, and represent the most uncomplicated relationship between Occupier and Occupied: unabashed traitor, become converted to the cause. And thus they also become evidence put forward by the Occupier that their will is supported within the city, for the Partial wants only to be Whole: to be the Occupier." Mobs of the Tyrant's black-clad, jack-booted undead thugs now wander the countryside, burning and killing and bludgeoning without care or reason except to terrorize what's left of humanity into submission.

Protip: If caught standing in the open, you can sometimes time your duck perfectly to avoid a shot.


Red Dragon Guard

GZDoom actor name: DragonGuard
Replaces: ChaingunGuy

Description: "He's like a bear. He's like a big shaved bear that hates people." These bloated, crimson-clad abominations form the Tyrant's elite personal guard and serve as commanders of the jackboots and stormtroopers beneath them. No expense was spared, apparently, when the Tyrant got each and every one of them a Vulcanette.

Protip: When you run for cover, the Dragon Guard's typical first reaction is to wait where he's shooting until you come back out, but he doesn't have much patience or empathy. See if you can find a way behind him.


Marines

ZDoom actor names: HDMarine, Rifleman, Enforcer, Infiltrator, Rocketeer; Tango, ShotTango, SMGTango, RocketTango, GhostRifleman, UndeadRifleman
Replaces: Player (on reanimation); ScriptedMarine and other marines

Description: Some people you meet are soldiers just like yourself in the war against the Tyrant. Others are less lucky, and appear as reanimated demon-possessed remains of the fallen. Yet others still turn against humanity of their own free will, selling their souls to the Tyrant for a small piece of his hellish dominion that they can call their own. In game terms, the last three in the list are identical to the first three, except without the +friendly flag.

Protip: In a normal Doom map you'll only see these guys if they've been raised by a healer imp or an archvile. They are far deadlier than any of the zombies, so try not to let the enemy create too many of them. If you end up with one anyway, a double-tap from the Slayer should do the trick, though explosives are generally safer.

The good news is that normal, non-hellspawn human bodies cannot be raised without some degeneration. After a few cycles undead marines become indistinguishable from ordinary zombies.

* NOTE TO MAPPERS: Please see "marine.txt" in the ZScript folder for customizing individually placed marines.


Imps

ZDoom actor names: FighterImp, HealerImp, MageImp
Replaces: DoomImp

Description: These toothy, spiny hominids were the dominant species from the Tyrant's homeworld, the remnant of ancient masters of arcane energy corrupted and diminished by their cruelty and hatred. They are now often seen bustling about in disorganized bands, unthinkingly eating anything edible-looking they find and burning the rest.

Imps come in three distinct types: the fighter, the mage, and the healer. Fighters are the most common and weakest but also the most vicious. Mages are the rarest, but both their sharper talons and superior fireball-casting more than make up for such shortcomings. But worst of all are the healers: have enough of these in a group coming your way with a few fighters to soak up the shots, and you can watch your easy fight turn into a gruelling, siege-like ordeal.

Though their hands can't reach inside the trigger guards to shoot properly, some imps keep pistols taken off their victims as war trophies - a fact to keep in mind when ammo is scarce and enemies must be prioritized.

Protip: The imp's fireball is a quantity of Frag-infused teleported hot gas held in place by a magical plasma membrane. When it comes into contact with something, the membrane ruptures at that point, sending out a jet stream of plasma into the target while binding itself magnetically to the target to maximize damage. This binding does NOT constantly track changes in the target's orientation, which means that if you can rapidly turn around and distribute the stream, you may be able to prevent it from penetrating and causing severe organ failure. It will still hurt like a motherfucker though.

This protip does not apply to the secondary function of the membrane found in some balls, which simply smear the burning gas onto you.


Babuin

GZDoom actor name: Babuin
Replaces: Demon

Description: Of course these evil godless Communists don't have dogs. Instead, they have these little devils who would like nothing more than to chew your gonads off and vomit them into your eyes.

Protip: Crouching to shoot reduces your room for error significantly. When grappling with one, try to bump it into the map geometry. Remember your pistol.


Spectre

GZDoom actor name: SpecBabuin
Replaces: Spectre

Description: Some babuins are capable of minor cloaking magic.

Protip: Robots are too stupid to be tricked by these illusions.


NinjaPirate

GZDoom actor name: NinjaPirate
Replaces: Spectre... sometimes

Description: As the imps were his enforcers, the great spectres served as the Tyrant's storm troops before contact with humanity. They strike only from close range, their tusked maws a septic mess of pain and death.

Protip: The only time a spectre moves faster than your sprint (at least at full health) is while cloaked and fleeing you. Conversely, it gets a bit lazy with its cloak when it is outside of crucial killing range. Oftentimes the best strategy is a retreat, however undignified.


Killer Barrel

GZDoom actor name: HDBarrel
Replaces: ExplosiveBarrel

Description: Throughout the Phobos and Deimos installations the UAC had stored hundreds of barrels of a special compound designed to hold Frag in a concentrated and transportable form. The Tyrant's minions took a liking to this practice, forced the recipe out of the technicians they captured, and starting putting it everywhere to help them establish a foothold on Earth. Now there are millions and millions of barrels of this volatile substance (nicknamed "nukage") stashed across the Earth. It may be decades before anyone can even begin to fathom the ecological damage. And now it seems that the hellish properties of Frag can take possession of the barrels themselves. Which means that among all these polluting barrels of crap, we've also got thousands of shuffling metal monstrosities with balefire attacks and an agenda to kill all humans...

Protip: Killer barrels generally lose their "life"-"giving" potential through animating their container, so they are generally safe to destroy.


Killer Burning Oil Barrel

GZDoom actor name: HDFireCan
Replaces: BurningBarrel

Description: Nukage and crude oil mix. When the resulting mixture is put into a barrel, it tends to spontaneously combust. Sometimes, the resulting mix of Hell energy, fossil fuel, and decaying metal melds into a freakish fire-belching abomination against all that is good and true. Fortunately, it is quite destructible.

Protip: They explode a lot sooner than a nukage barrel and can set one off nearby, so if you see them together shoot the burning barrel first.


Putto

GZDoom actor name: Putto
Replaces: some boss cubes

Description: These ghostly little four-faced metal terrors drift through the polluted air, flinging toxic balls of balefire at you. Where these flames come from no one knows, since the source is instantly destroyed in a searing fireball once the monster has been damaged beyond its ability to function in combat.

Protip: Getting caught by the blast of a bursting fireball may prevent you from returning fire long enough for the putto to hit you again. The best strategy is to remain on the move until you can land a good, clean hit with a rifle or shotgun.


Yokai

GZDoom actor name: Yokai
Replaces: Various

Description: These floating evil eyes latch onto you with their gaze and lock you into their twisted, numbing reality, slowly doing damage and wearing you out. They seem to have an affinity for energy weapons and often appear where such might be found.

Protip: The yokai has no physical weapon that it can stab you in the back with. There is no need to look at it until the last split second.


Lost Soul

ZDoom actor names: Condemned
Replaces: LostSoul

Description: "How *can* you go on talking all that rot? Your wonderful Lion didn't come and help you, did he? Thought not. And now—even now—when you've been beaten and shoved into this black hole, just the same as the rest of us, you're still at your old game. Starting a new lie! Trying to make us believe we're none of us shut up, and it ain't dark, and heaven knows what." They can't stop burning and don't want you to stop burning either! Unfortunately they are not in a place where they can listen to a reasoned call for repentance, and all you can really do is keep yourself from being consumed along with them and becoming even more fuel for their masters.

Protip: Treat the lost soul as a weaker babuin that just happens to be capable of flight. And capable of burning you to a crisp if you leave it on for too long.


Pain Elemental

GZDoom actor name: Jailer
Replaces: PainElemental

Description: A jailer and a gate. Smashing him yourself would only cause him to collapse and maybe send a few of his prisoners on temporary assignment. His few releasees he tends to keep on a short leash, and once taken down they cannot be compelled back into the world by other passing demons.

Protip: Engaging up close isn't as good a tactic as before. Not only does it have a melee attack, any lost souls that it does spit explode if they die after spawning in a bad place. Needless to say, the pain elemental itself also explodes.


Cacodemon

GZDoom actor name: CacaDemon
Replaces; Cacodemon
Description: One thing is for sure: the Tyrant did not attack us to steal our plasma rifle technology. These monsters send swathes of vaporizingly hot charged material that gently drift towards the target, scorching anything in its path. To make things worse, sometimes it follows this up with a savage power attack that can send you flying one piece at a time.

Once you see the flash, you have two options: duck and cover, or shoot it until it dies. A single ZM66 magazine is plenty enough firepower to make sure that a cacodemon is dead: full auto is your friend.

Protip: The cacodemon's ball lightning travels so slowly that at closer engagements you're actually better off circlestrafing it with a pistol.


Arachnotron

GZDoom actor name: Krangling
Replaces: Arachnotron

Description: These brain repletes are armed with particle beam guns - quiet as a mouse and able to stomp you like one. When you hear its signature screech, take all steps necessary to neutralize the threat immediately.

Protip: To spend time aiming at the arachnotron is to tempt fate. The surest way to kill one is to lure it into your grenade. They are vulnerable up close as long as you do not approach them head-on.


Revenant

GZDoom actor name: Boner
Replaces: Revenant

Description: These tall, rigid warriors stand at attention ready to slap you around and shoot their load all over your face. The bad news is that the innuendo is unwarranted, and these undead, un-sexy fleshless skeletal automatons of average height are only after some distinctly un-erotic murder. And their posture is just awful.

Protip: Shotguns fare somewhat better than rifles against revenants. The spread may also be helpful against their missiles, which are one of the rare projectiles that can be shot down.


Mancubus

GZDoom actor name: Mancubus
Replaces: Fatso

Description: The Tyrant feels no shame in mocking the defeated. Originally built from the corpses of morbidly obese humans captured after the invasion of Earth, armed with a pair of grossly inefficient gasoline-fueled plasma launchers, these sweaty, greasy, smoky cyborgs stand tall and proud as a shining symbol of humanity's perpetual need for cheap energy and resources that got us tampering with the horrors of the Anomalies to begin with.

Protip: The mancubus is so slow that even an alert one with a clear path to you can be taken out with an uncooked hand grenade. Which can be quite useful for something you really don't want line of sight with for any period of time.


Hell Knave

GZDoom actor name: HellKnave
Replaces: HellKnight

Description: These petty officers of the Tyrant's legions saturate their immediate vicinity with balefire to make sure that whatever they hate is going to be dead. They can summon putti to their aid if necessary.

Protip: Unlike its bigger cousin the hell knave is not resistant to explosives. A grenade around the corner can take one out, or at least soften it up enough for you to pop in and finish it off with a double-barreled hit of the Slayer. If that is not enough, retreat immediately.


Hell Prince

GZDoom actor name: HellPrince
Replaces: BaronOfHell

Description: The Tyrant's trusted lieutenants in the Phobos war. Able to withstand ludicrous amounts of damage without slowing down, the hell prince supplements its balefire attack by summoning a secondary projectile that resembles (and sometimes is) a charging lost soul.

Protip: The hell prince's skull shot looks scary, but it's mostly a distraction from the fan of seeking missiles around it. It is the only boss monster that can regenerate so don't take your time.


Archfiend

GZDoom actor name: ArchFiend
Replaces: ArchVile

Description: A miserable shadow of their once glorious past, these fallen angels now know only destruction and hatred and the fires of Hell. They detest the Tyrant they serve, forever bound by a blood oath made as a condition of being freed from the Abyss. Their only remaining creative power is to restore life and limb to the fallen, for the sole purpose of continuing their own dark master's battle.

Protip: Unlike all other monsters, who are taken down after suffering a certain amount of gross damage, the archfiend must feel pain a certain number of times to be destroyed. When the archvile finally does die do try to stay away from dead mancubi and hell princes for a while until you can escape the map...


Archangel

GZDoom actor name: ArchAngel
Replaces: None

Description: There are rumours about that some of the fallen angels have gone turncoat, possibly realizing the error of their ways after eons of timeless damnation. Others say that these are not fallen at all, but actual angels sent to mankind's aid under certain limitations. Or perhaps these are not limitations at all, and that the fallen are less degraded than once thought. Then again, they may be double agents, or tempters of another sort. Perhaps none of the proposed answers is true; perhaps they are all true, or there are as many answers as there are these friendly angels. They're not saying anything, though.

Protip: Get out of the way and let them do their work. They are somewhat more maneuverable than their fallen brethren, so should you happen across one you shouldn't find it too difficult to make sure it's still by your side.


Ultimate Purgatory Eschaton Satan Robo X

GZDoom actor name: SatanRobo
Replaces: Cyberdemon

Description: "Dear Santa: I want a giant fucking robot for Christmas. To get rid of all these other horrible problems I have to deal with. Like other giant fucking robots. Especially the ones that like nothing more than to send a barrage of rockets at the slightest suggestion of line of sight with me, each the size of a grown man's torso. I would say I've been a really good boy this year just by putting up with this shit. Yours truly, Doomguy."

Protip: The cyberdemon is the most heavily shielded boss that is not covered in map geometry. Sustained fire and follow-up attacks are critical. Try setting up traps, get as many things wearing down that shield at once as you can. Give the BFG ball enough time to shoot it until it dies.


Spiderdemon

GZDoom actor name: Spiderdemon
Replaces: SpiderMastermind

Description: Galloping trigger-happy freak with a full-length-round version of the Vulcanette.

Protip: The spiderdemon's shields regenerate more slowly than the cyberdemon's, but you will have fewer chances to land a shot before getting winged by its shots.


The Tyrant

GZDoom actor name: TheTyrant, HDBBE
Replaces: BossBrain, BossEye

Description: If only the source of all evil in the world were so singular and killable. This is the mortal avatar of the Tyrant, a vast demonic force that births its nightmare armies from its invincible stone skull like a billion spined, hissing Pallas Athenae.

Protip: Don't bother with that stupid platform, just aim and shoot and hope and be ready to shoot again if your first shot was blocked by a cube. The Thunder Buster is a powerful asset if you can keep the defenders from throwing off your aim. As with the archvile, the Tyrant must feel pain a certain number of times before its avatar will depart this world (or whichever one its form happens to be inhabiting).
