			  hd_manual.txt: Detailed overview of the mod.
			  hd.txt: This file.

			  Note: It is strongly recommended that you go into your GZDoom
			  settings and set your channels to as many as your computer can handle.

Description             : Changes some monster, weapon, and player behaviours for a slightly
			  different game experience, in addition to some cosmetic changes.
			  Normally any individual zombie's purpose is not to pose an immediate
			  threat, but to nibble away at a player's resources to make their
			  prospects for the next encounter just a little bit worse. This wad
			  changes things to put more focus on the individual encounter, giving
			  you more ammo and regenerating health at the cost of much more lethal
			  enemies the least of whom is quite capable of killing you if you're
			  not careful.

			  In short: Think the final shootout from The Way of the Gun, and then
			  throw in some fire-spitting monsters.

			  Please see hd_manual.txt for detailed instructions.

* Construction *

Base/Rips               :
	Project title, of course, from the Judas Priest lyrics.
	Earlier DECORATE work started off as modified Doom definitions posted on the ZDoom Wiki.
	Modified Doom sprites are exactly what they look like.
	Alpha sprites are ripped indirectly from Deathz0r's alpha 4 rips: http://deathz0r.unidoom.org/doom/alpha.php
	Babuin sprites from IMX's Demonicron mod, based on Icytux's pinky demon edit.
	Thanks to Xim for the modified chaingunner sprites.
	Thanks to HotWax for the ACS needed for the dmflag 256 fix.
	Female player sounds from Unreal Tournament.
	Female player mugshot is taken straight from FEMDOOM.WAD, complete with text file.
	Additional sounds:
	 ZM66: http://soundbible.com/1449-P90-Machine-Gun-Fire.html P90 by ruin
	 Big rifles: http://soundbible.com/1638-M1-Garand-Gun.html M1 Garand by battlestar10
	 Brass: http://soundbible.com/2072-Shell-Falling.html Shell falling by Marcel
	 Bolt: http://soundbible.com/2024-Sniper-Fire-Reload.html Sniper fire reload by Mike Koenig
	All other weapon firing sounds are modifications of regular Doom sounds.
	All other weapon and monster sprites are modifications of regular Doom weapon sprites.
	Copy of Psalms from UMichigan website: http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV1&byte=2190116
Inspiration             :
	Gameplay heavily influenced by the final firefight in "The Way of the Gun" (2000).
	Also of note is the 2006 Casino Royale remake, as an idea of what sort of changes were made.
	Health system inspired by the Opera Half-Life mod.
	Babuin originally inspired by the discussion on pit bull size in the Intuitor review of The Hulk.
		More insultingly stupid movie physics: http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/
	Weapons partially inspired by the Infiltration UT Mod.
		http://infiltration.sentrystudios.net/
	Quite a few DECORATE implementations (and idea for the BFG) taken from eliw00d's GZDoom Advanced.
		http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=15537
	Portable medikits and stimpacks stolen from Ryan Cordell's Demon Wars.
		http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=13376
Build Time              : On and off from the release of ZDoom 2.0.63 onwards (Feb. 2004)
Editor(s) used          : In chronological order: Notepad, Notepad2, Ulead PhotoImpact, MS Paint, Photoshop, DeuTex, CleanWAD, ACC, XWE, WinRAR, Leafpad, SetPNG, file-roller, Krita, Kolourpaint, GrabPNG, Slade; GDCC-ACC; Notepad++
Known Bugs              :
	Every so often fragmentary explosives will force friendly fire in co-op and team games.
	On rare occasions the lives system's end-level script won't kick in and you must change levels manually.
	Partially spent magazines and cells are not tracked and are randomized each time you access them.
	New movement speeds may preclude certain areas from being reached.
